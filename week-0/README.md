## PCA from Scratch and Comparison with scikit-learn on MNIST

In this week's assignment, we demonstrate how to implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using NumPy. It includes comparisons with `scikit-learn`'s PCA on real-world data (MNIST dataset) and visualizations using synthetic datasets.

## Features

- PCA implemented without for-loops for performance.
- Two synthetic 2D datasets for PCA visualization.
- Comparison of custom PCA with `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`.
- Application of PCA on the MNIST dataset (60,000 images of size 28x28).
- Plotting of PCA projections to visualize effectiveness.

## Requirements

I have created all the dependencies used in `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
