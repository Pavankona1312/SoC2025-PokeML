# Linear & Logistic Regression - WEEK 1

In week-1, we will be implementating **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using minimal libraries to promote a deeper understanding of machine learning principles.

## Task 1: Linear Regression
- **Smoll Regression**: Predicts fruit yield from climate data using gradient descent.
- **Big Regression**: Predicts house rent from 4700+ samples. Includes train-test split and MSE evaluation.

## Task 2: Basic Logistic Regression
- Binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification using `(x, y)` coordinates.
- Covers appropriate loss functions and decision boundaries for each case.

## Task 3: Applied Logistic Regression
- **MNIST Digit Recognition**: Classify handwritten digits using logistic regression.
- **Cats vs Dogs**: Binary image classification using Kaggle dataset. Highlights challenges of image-based linear models.
