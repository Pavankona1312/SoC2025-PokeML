# FROM SCRATCH: LINEAR REGRESSION AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION - WEEK 1

In week 1, we will be implementing **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using minimal libraries to promote a deeper understanding of machine learning principles.

## Task 1: Linear Regression

### Smoll Regression
- Predicts fruit yield from climate data using gradient descent. 
### Big Regression
- Predicts house rent from 4700+ samples.  
- Train-test split and MSE evaluation performed.

## Task 2: Basic Logistic Regression

Each subtask uses (x, y) coordinate features and includes binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification.

### Subtasks & Files:
- Subtask 1: Parabola Classification
